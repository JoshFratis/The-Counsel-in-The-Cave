The Counsel in The Cave was written, designed and illustrated by Joshua Fratis. The project was made as part of the Creative Arts Fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh’s David C. Frederick Honors College. It is written in Ink, a narrative scripting language for games.

The Counsel in The Cave began as a Twine game-- an interactive adaptation of a poem I wrote. Since then, it’s grown a lot! The story spans three acts, each one written in episodic vignettes. Three vignettes were released on July 14th, 2022. 

Even with its expanded scope, The Counsel in The Cave remains playable in a web browser. This is made possible by Ink. My own modifications to Ink’s default web export program, written in HTML and JavaScript, makes The Counsel in The Cave’s signature stage play style possible.
