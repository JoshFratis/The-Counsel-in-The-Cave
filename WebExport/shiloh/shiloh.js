To our right, tall trees line the edge of a small wood. In the forest’s center, not far from here, is a well kept lawn and a sturdy pavilion for picnic benches. Sidewalk chalk decorates its floor. All around it, gravel walking paths weave between the trees. Some extend further past the forest’s other side, through soccer fields and parking lots, to Shiloh Hills Elementary School.","\n","^Below us on the left, unkempt vegetation grows more wild. Low tangled trees root from rocky creek-beds. Dense brushes push against one another. Mosquitoes buzz and hum. This jumbled brush carries out to a low fence line, barely able to be seen as it is, flooded in leaves. Beyond this, the distance is occupied by rolling squares of farmland.","\n","^Between the forest and the brush, a narrow field of clovers falls dramatically up and down in a series of steep hills, formed by man-made creeks that run right to left across the stage. They guide runoff from the forest to the reservoir below, hidden somewhere in the brush.","\n","^Power lines are strung above the hills. They zig-zag into the distance, anchored by transmission towers, massive lattices of steel that stand out on the hilltop.","\n","^The field exists in some space between the lofty wooded park and the unkempt abandon. It’s kept clean of trees for the power lines above, but is not without thick washes of long kept clovers. Your feet would sink down if you stepped into the field, leaving tracks of trampled clovers where you went.","\n","^Two teenagers, Jason and May, enter the foreground from a gravel path that overlooks the green. Jason wears baggy jeans and an old striped shirt. May wears shorts and a heavy work shirt.
